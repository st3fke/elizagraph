AI Travel Planner
    - The Plan Traveler Agent is an innovative travel planning tool developed using React, TypeScript, and integrated within the elizagraph framework powered by elizOS. It is designed to simplify and streamline the travel planning process, offering users a seamless experience for organizing trips. By combining a user-friendly interface with robust backend support, the agent ensures that all essential travel details are accessible and customizable in one place.

    - At the core of the Plan Traveler Agent is a dynamic form that collects user inputs regarding their travel preferences and requirements. The form is intuitive and interactive, asking users for key details such as their desired destination, travel dates, the number of nights they plan to stay, and their preferred modes of transport. Once the form is submitted, the agent processes the input data and generates tailored travel recommendations. This includes suggested plane and bus routes, complete with schedules and estimated travel times, ensuring users can make well-informed decisions about their journey.

    - Additionally, the agent provides detailed accommodation options by displaying hotel prices for the specified number of nights. Users can explore these options to find the most suitable place to stay based on their budget and preferences. By integrating pricing data with travel routes, the Plan Traveler Agent offers a holistic approach to travel planning, saving users time and effort.

    - This project leverages the flexibility and power of React and TypeScript to create a modern, responsive front-end, while elizOS ensures efficient data processing and integration. The combination of cutting-edge technology and practical functionality makes the Plan Traveler Agent a valuable tool for travelers looking to plan trips effortlessly. Future updates aim to include advanced features such as real-time updates for flight and bus schedules, personalized hotel recommendations, and integrations with booking platforms to finalize travel arrangements seamlessly.

How to make our agent work?
    1. pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
    2. pnpm run build
    If everything was OK and there were no errors, open two terminals
    and run one command in each terminal.
    3.1 pnpm start:client(This command is used to start our React application in which
    we can talk to our agents and give them data to work with)
    3.2 pnpm start:plant (This command is used for running two agents at the same time.
    It starts both characters, Miodrak and Slobodanka, by their respective commands
    pnpm start:plantm and pnpm start:plantf)

- After that our agents are ready to work with you! Access them via the React application
on localhost:5173.
