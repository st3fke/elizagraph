# @elizaos/plugin-dkg

ElizaOS agent powered by Knowledge Graph memories.
Based on the ElizaOS plugin enabling integration with the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) for enhanced knowledge graph retrieval, search and knowledge management with ElizaOS agents.

## Description

The DKG plugin extends ElizaOS functionality by allowing agents to create knowledge graph based memories in the form of Knowledge assets on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph. This plugin enables SPARQL-based searches on the DKG and combines these results with Eliza's regular search results. Additionally, it creates a memory as a Knowledge Asset on the DKG after a response, making it available for future SPARQL queries.

This is an experimental project. Feel free to clone, play around and contribute bug fixes or new features. Use this repo as a "agent starter repo". The plugin-dkg will be included into the official ElizaOS repo as well in the coming weeks

Check out the example agent running on X: https://x.com/ChatDKG

## Features

### 1. OriginTrail DKG Integration

- Perform knowledge graph queries on the DKG for knowledge extraction (using SPARQL)
- Combine DKG query results with Eliza's internal search capabilities.
- Enhance responses with decentralized and trusted knowledge.

### 2. Knowledge Asset Creation

- Automatically generate Knowledge Assets based on interactions.
- Publish memory Knowledge Assets to the DKG for future retrieval.

## Providers

### 1. DKG Search Provider

- Executes SPARQL queries on the OriginTrail DKG.
- Retrieves and formats relevant results.
- Integrates DKG data with Eliza’s response system.

## Plugins

### 1. Memory Creation Plugin

- Creates Knowledge Assets from agent interactions.
- Publishes assets to the DKG with contextual metadata.

## INSTALLATION

## Prerequisites

- Python 2.7+
- Node.js 23+
- pnpm


## Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Build the plugin:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

4. Run linting:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

## Usage

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

- Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
- Fill in the necessary details:
    - Node information.
    - LLM key.
    - Twitter credentials.

### 2. Customize DKG Knowledge Asset & Query Templates

- Modify the templates in `plugin-dkg/constants.ts` if you need to change the ontology or data format used in the Knowledge Graph.

### 3. Create a Character and Run the Agent

- Create a character file in the `characters` folder.
- Run the character using the following command:
    ```bash
    pnpm start --characters="characters/chatdkg.character.json"
    ```


### Notes

- There is no need to manually add `plugin-dkg` to the `plugins` array; it will load automatically.
- Ensure you configure the Twitter client and select your LLM provider in the character settings.

## Dependencies

- @elizaos/core: workspace:\*
- SPARQL query library: workspace:\*
- DKG JavaScript SDK: dkg.js > ^8.0.4
